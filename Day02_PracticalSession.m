%% =============1D Fourier Transform===================================================================
% compute an average (across pixels) power spectrum of the evoked signal, make a plot with error bars.
% the signal is recorded at 200 Hz, use this information to plot the power
% spectra on a correct x-axis (frequency). 


% Do the same as before but first compute the power spectra on individual
% trials and then average the power spectra. 


% Why is it different?


%% ============BASICS =======================================================================================
%% Compute the signal to noise ratio of between stimulus ON and OFF conditions in dB.



%% =============2D Fourier Transform=========================================================================
% Compute the Fourier transform of the HRF responses and detect the peak
% frequency in the power spectrum.
%
%
% Create a series of delta functions and compute their Fourier Transoform.


% Compute the power spectrum of the monkey and forest images (in ...).
% Use the 3 masks provided to zero-down all the power and bring make an inverse transform to pixel space.
% Where is the spectral energy (high vs. low frequencies, horizontal vs. vertical orientations) most densely located ?


% Create a random image (same size as the forest image) and compute its power spectrum.


% Make an inverse FFT of a data that consists of the phase spectrum of the random image and amplitude spectra of the forest image.
% How does the result look like?
